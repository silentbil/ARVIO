## Content And Source Policy

ARVIO is a media browser and player interface for user-configured sources. It works like a media player or browser: users provide their own services, playlists, addons, and URLs.

This repository does not include hosted media content, bundled playlists, IPTV credentials, debrid accounts, third-party streaming catalogs, or links intended to enable unauthorized access to content. No movies, series, live TV channels, playlists, or other third-party media are hosted by this repository or by ARVIO.

Users are solely responsible for their usage and must comply with applicable local laws. If you believe content accessed through an external source violates copyright law, contact the actual file host, service provider, or source maintainer. The ARVIO repository and developers cannot remove content hosted by third parties.

Contributors should not submit copyrighted media, credentials, private keys, access tokens, or links intended to enable unauthorized access to content.

## Build And Run

Requirements:

- Android Studio or Android SDK command-line tools
- JDK 17
- Android SDK 35

Use the tracked Gradle wrapper:

```bash
./gradlew :app:assemblePlayDebug
./gradlew :app:assembleSideloadDebug
```

On Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat :app:assemblePlayDebug
.\gradlew.bat :app:assembleSideloadDebug
```

Install a debug build on a connected Android TV, Fire TV, emulator, phone, or tablet:

```bash
./gradlew :app:installPlayDebug
./gradlew :app:installSideloadDebug
```

For network ADB devices:

```bash
adb connect <device-ip>:5555
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/sideload/debug/app-sideload-debug.apk
```

Build variants:

- `play`: Play Store build, self-update and CloudStream runtime disabled.
- `sideload`: Direct APK build, self-update and CloudStream runtime enabled.
- `debug`: development build.
- `staging`: release-like build signed with the debug keystore for upgrade testing.
- `release`: production build. Use a private release keystore for distribution.

## Local Configuration

Cloud sync, Google sign-in, and Supabase-backed auth require local secrets. Copy the defaults file and fill in real values:

```bash
cp secrets.defaults.properties secrets.properties
```

`secrets.properties` is ignored and must not be committed.

For signed release builds, copy the keystore template and fill in local signing values:

```bash
cp keystore.properties.template keystore.properties
```

`keystore.properties` and keystore files are ignored and must stay private.

## Release Checks

Before publishing a build, run:

```bash
./gradlew :app:compilePlayDebugKotlin
./gradlew :app:assemblePlayRelease
./gradlew :app:assembleSideloadRelease
```

Smoke-test startup, profile switching, playback, stream fallback, subtitle/audio switching, IPTV/EPG loading, addon add/remove, search, settings navigation, background sync, and repeated player open/close on the supported device classes.
